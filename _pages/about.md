I am currently a fianl-year master student at <a href="https://www.sdu.edu.cn/">Shandong University</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://math.wh.sdu.edu.cn/new_rw-content-js.jsp?urltype=news.NewsContentUrl&wbtreeid=1013&wbnewsid=5960">Xu Zhang</a>. I received my bachelor's degree from <a href="https://www.sdu.edu.cn/">Shandong University</a> in June 2021. I am fortunate to work with Prof. <a href="https://www2.scut.edu.cn/math/2017/1227/c14582a242258/page.htm">Qigui Yang</a> from South China University of Technology. My research interest lies in differential equations and dynamical systems.
